Action Manager by TheCoCe
The action manager script is a simple way to program simple action sequences without the need for timer blocks. 
The script supports multiple sequences per programmable block that you can run via the agruments of the block. 
You can execute any action you can execute via the terminal and set or check properties of the block or group.
