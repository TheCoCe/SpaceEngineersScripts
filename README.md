# SpaceEngineersScripts
A small collection of the Space Engineers Scripts I've written for my private game using https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE

## Airlock Script
Simple airlock script supporting a two way, lossless passage. Airlocks must consist out of two doors, a vent and sensor inside the airlock.
The Scripts also support two optional vertical 'Corner LCD Flat' Screens for airlock status.

## Drill Speed Toggle
Simple script for automating piston drill operation. The Script checks the current input and adjusts the piston speed to match the drill load.
